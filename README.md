# CSE472_MycroftOrMoriarty
Repository for the submissions at Contradictory, My Dear Watson, a open Kaggle competition, attempted as the term project in the course CSE472: Machine Learning Sessional.

---

The Kaggle competition, "Contradictory My Dear Watson," issues a challenge to confront the complexities of multilingual text. The competition signifies the development of models that can detect contradictions and entailments across diverse languages, highlighting the need for cross-lingual understanding. We extended the project from the competition into finding significant results in terms of Bangla language inference, using a BanglaBERT dataset.

After some research and experimentation on the dataset, we tried using the pretrained model without a classifier on it. The results were far better than we expected, making it the best submission we had on the competition. We tried the model on the Bangla NLI dataset by BanglaBERT, and it showed better results than the source paper.
